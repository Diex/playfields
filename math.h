;------------------------------------------------

; Notes:
;
; This file contains a number of useful 6502
; algorithms for number, string and memory
; operations. The code is written in the form of
; macros rather than subroutines to make them
; more flexible.
;
; The routines in the library assume that 16 and
; 32 bit numbers are represented in little endian
; order, that is the least significant byte in
; the lowest memory location, so that they can
; be applied to addresses as well as pure
; numbers.
;
; The string routines assume that they are
; working with null terminated 'C' style strings.
;
; The main routines sacrifice code size for speed
; and are coded without any iteration. Compact
; versions which use iteration are provided for
; some algorithms and have the same name as the
; original routine with a 'C' suffix (eg. _XFR32
; => _XFR32C).
;
; Some of the macros use 65SC02 instructions for
; speed or to reduce the amount code generated if
; the assembler will accept them.
;
; Where possible the macros detect optimizable
; cases and generate more efficient code.
;
; Bugs & Enhancments:
;
; If you find a bug I missed or have a new
; routine you would like to submit to the library
; then mail me at:
